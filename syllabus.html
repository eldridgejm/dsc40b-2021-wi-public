    Two Sections of DSC 40B
</h2>

<p>This quarter there are two sections of DSC 40B on the course schedule; section <code>A00</code> is
listed as being taught by <strong>Prof. Justin Eldridge</strong>, and section <code>B00</code> is listed as being taught by
<strong>Prof. Yusu Wang</strong>. We will be <em>co-teaching</em> DSC 40B, however, and will be sharing
homeworks, exams, discussions, etc. In essence, there is <em>no practical difference</em>
between the two sections. We <em>will</em> have two different lectures &mdash; one live via Zoom,
the other pre-recorded &mdash; however, you may attend whichever lecture you would like.
See the below section on <a href="#lectures">lectures</a> for more information.</p>
<p>All of the information below applies to both sections unless otherwise stated.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">
    <i class="em em-passenger_ship" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i>
    &nbsp;
    Getting Started
</h2>

<p>To get started in DSC 40B, you'll need to set up accounts on a couple of
websites.</p>
<h4 id="campuswire">Campuswire</h4>
<p>We'll be using <a href="https://campuswire.com/c/GBD5E4622">Campuswire</a>
as our course message board. Campuswire is like
Piazza, but unlike Piazza, Campuswire does not sell student data to third
parties. You should have received an invitation via email, but if not you should get in
touch with a course staff member as soon as possible, as we'll be making all
course announcements via Campuswire.</p>
<p>If you have a question about anything to do with the course  &mdash; if you're stuck on a
homework problem, want clarification on the logistics, or just have a general question
about data science &mdash; you can make a post on Campuswire. We only ask that if your
question includes some or all of an answer, please make your post <strong>private</strong> so that
others cannot see it. You can also post anonymously if you would prefer.</p>
<p>Course staff will regularly check Campuswire and try to answer any questions that you
have. You're also encouraged to answer a question asked by another student if you
feel that you know the answer.</p>
<h4 id="gradescope">Gradescope</h4>
<p>We'll be using 
<a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/214157">Gradescope</a> for
homework submission and grading. Most of the assignments will be a mixture of math and
coding, and the coding parts are usually autograded via Gradescope.,
You should have received an email invitation for Gradescope, but if not please
let us know as soon as possible (preferably via Campuswire).</p>
<h4 id="zoom">Zoom</h4>
<p>Some aspects of the course, like office hours and the remote discussion, will be held using
Zoom. You should already have an account through UCSD; see the <a href="https://edtech.ucsd.edu/education-continuity-tools-and-resources/zoom-guides.html">Zoom
guide</a>
for more help. Note that you will <strong>not</strong> be expected to have a webcam!</p>
<h4 id="canvas">Canvas</h4>
<p>We'll use <a href="canvas.ucsd.edu">Canvas</a> for the course gradebook and for the exams.</p>
<h4 id="required-materials">Required Materials</h4>
<p>No materials are required for this course; we'll use online video lectures as
the main resource, as well as our own <a href="./published/default/notes/book.pdf">course notes</a>.
That said, here are some books that you might find useful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein; <em>Introduction to Algorithms</em></li>
<li>Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, Vazirani; <em>Algorithms</em></li>
</ul>
<p>You will <strong>not</strong> need a webcam, but you'll need a way to access the internet and
to upload pictures of your homework. If you foresee this being problematic
&mdash; or you find that you're unable to fully participate in the class for any
reason &mdash; send us a message on Campuswire and
we'll figure it out.</p>
<h2 id="lectures">
<i class="em em-male-teacher" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i>
&nbsp;
Lectures
</h2>

<p>DSC 40B is entirely online this quarter due to the <i class="em em-microbe"
aria-role="presentation" aria-label="MICROBE"></i>. To accommodate different learning
schedules and time zones, both of us (Profs. Wang and Eldridge) will be providing
lectures in different, complementary formats. The lectures will cover the same material
(though perhaps in slightly different ways), so you can attend either lecture
no matter which section you are enrolled in. Students who wish to have an interactive
live lecture at a regularly-scheduled time are encouraged to attend Prof. Wang's Zoom
lectures, while students in other time zones are encouraged to watch Prof. Eldridge's
pre-recorded lectures.</p>
<h4 id="prof-wangs-live-zoom-lectures">Prof. Wang's Live Zoom Lectures</h4>
<p>Prof. Wang's lectures will be live on Zoom at 11 am on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The link
to the Zoom meeting is
<a href="https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/96746348905">https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/96746348905</a>; this link will be the same
for every lecture. The meeting is password protected, and you can find the password on
Campuswire. Note  that the lectures <em>will</em> be recorded, and a link to the recording will
be posted on the course webpage after the lecture.</p>
<h4 id="prof-eldridges-pre-recorded-lectures">Prof. Eldridge's Pre-Recorded Lectures</h4>
<p>Prof. Eldridge's lectures will be pre-recorded YouTube videos. Links to these videos
will be posted before the regularly-scheduled lecture time of 2pm PST on Tuesdays and
Thursdays. You will be able to watch them whenever is most convenient for you.  </p>
<h2 id="discussions">
<i class="em em-raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i>
&nbsp;
Discussions
</h2>

<p>We will have weekly, hour-long live Zoom <strong>discussion</strong> sections led by the TA and focused on
solving problems.  The discussions review the materials from that week's lectures and
prepare you for the homework. Just as with lecture, topics and techniques introduced
in discussion might appear on the homework and in exams. In particular, some of the more
difficult homework problems may be partially solved in discussion section to give you a
good start. </p>
<p>Because there are technically two lecture sections, there are also two discussion
sections. 
One discussion will be held on Thursdays at  4:00 pm PST via Zoom.
The second discussion section will be held immediately after at 5:00 pm, also via Zoom. </p>
<p>Both discussion meetings will cover the same material, but we are holding both since
some people might not be able to attend the other section due to scheduling conflicts.</p>
<p>The Zoom meeting link for the discussion will be available on the front page of the
course website, and a discussion worksheet will be posted beforehand. During discussion,
you'll work together with classmates on solving these problems.</p>
<p>Virtual attendance in discussion section is recommended, but not required.
We'll record the discussion and post the link on the front page of the course
site.</p>
<h2 id="office-hours">
<i class="em em-hourglass_flowing_sand" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="HOURGLASS WITH FLOWING SAND"></i>
&nbsp;
Office Hours
</h2>

<p>Course staff, including tutors, TAs, and instructors, will hold office hours
regularly throughout the week. This quarter, all office hours will be via Zoom.
Please see the <a href="./office_hours.html">office hours</a> page for
the schedule and for instructions.</p>
<h2 id="homeworks">
<i class="em em-house_with_garden" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="HOUSE WITH GARDEN"></i>
&nbsp;
Homeworks
</h2>

<p>There will be eight homeworks assigned throughout the quarter, plus one <a href="#the-super-homework">"super homework"</a>
(described below).
Homeworks will be a mixture of written problems (which are manually graded by our tutor
staff) and coding problems (which are autograded).
Each homework will be due via
Gradescope at 11:59 PM on the tuesday after it is assigned except otherwise
noted, and you'll have roughly a week to complete each assignment from the time it is
posted. The lowest homework will be dropped.</p>
<p>The homework due date is carefully chosen to fit within a one week "cycle". On Tuesdays
and Thursdays, you'll have lecture. That week's discussion will review the lecture
topics with an eye towards practical application. The homework is then due the
<em>following</em> week, giving you several days after the discussion to complete it.</p>
<h4 id="homework-redemption">Homework Redemption</h4>
<p>You should think of the homeworks as practice towards the goal of mastering
the topics in DSC 40B. But the first time you practice anything, you're not going
to be perfect. The key is to <a href="&lt;BS&gt;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-010416-044022"><em>learn from the
mistakes</em></a>.</p>
<p>To encourage this,
DSC 40B uses the concept of "redemption" on homework assignments. Under this policy,
you may regain full credit for a homework problem that was previously done incorrectly by
submitting an explanation of your mistake along with a correction.
This policy encourages you to revisit homework mistakes in order to correct your
understanding, and allows us to give quick, targeted feedback through grading.</p>
<p>Not all homework problems are eligible for redemption, unfortunately, as we do not have
the resources to regrade longer, more involved problems. 
Those problems that <em>are</em> eligible for redemption will be marked as such. 
The homeworks
late in the quarter may be ineligible for redemption due to insufficient time to request
and grade redemptions before the quarter ends. The policy of dropping the lowest
homework serves to offer some relief in the case that you perform poorly on problems
that are not eligible for redemption.</p>
<p>Problems that are eligible for redemption are graded as either right or wrong with
no partial credit according to the following scale:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="text-success font-weight-bold">Green</span>: You had the right idea,
        and you get full credit for the problem.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="text-warning font-weight-bold">Yellow</span>: Your approach
        showed effort, but wasn't right. For now it will receive zero credit, but you
        can receive full credit by submitting a proper "redemption request" (see below).
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="text-danger font-weight-bold">Red</span>: You didn't answer
        the problem, or showed no work. No credit is awarded and you are not permitted
        to submit a redemption request.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If you got the problem correct, you'll receive the total number of points for it. If you
didn't get the problem correct, even due to a relatively small mistake, you'll receive no
credit <em>until</em> you submit a redemption request. In this way, everyone will eventually
receive full credit on every problem that is eligible for redemption, <em>provided</em> that
they submit redemption requests.</p>
<h4 id="redemption-requests">Redemption Requests</h4>
<p>To submit a redemption request for a 
<span class="text-warning font-weight-bold">Yellow</span> solution:</p>
<ol>
<li>Review your answer to find your mistake, comparing it to the solutions posted
   on the course webpage.</li>
<li>Submit a <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/help#help-center-item-student-regrades">regrade
   request</a>
   for the problem on Gradescope, or by attending a tutor's office hours. In your
   regrade request, identify your mistake and what you would need to do to correct it.
   The amount of detail needed in your request depends on how complex your mistake was;
   if it was a simple one, only one or two sentences may be necessary.</li>
<li>A grader will review your request shortly (as long as you submit it
   within a week of the homework scores being posted, your regrade request will
   be reviewed). If you aren't able to identify what you did incorrectly, you'll
   be asked to attend a grader's office hours in order to discuss the problem in
   more detail.</li>
</ol>
<div class="alert alert-danger"> 
Warning! We will not be able to handle redemption requests which are submitted more than
a week after you have received your grade.
</div>

<h4 id="slip-days">Slip Days</h4>
<p>You have four <strong>slip days</strong> to use throughout the quarter. A slip day extends the
deadline of any one homework by 24 hours. Slip days cannot be "stacked" or "combined" to
extend the deadline further &mdash;
the latest any one homework can be submitted is 24 hours after the deadline.
Slip days are applied automatically at the end of the quarter, but it's your
responsibility to keep track of how many you have left.</p>
<p>Slip days are designed to be a transparent and predictable source of leniency in
deadlines. You can use a slip day if you are too busy to complete an assignment on its
original due date (or if you forgot about it). But slips days are also meant for things
like the internet going down at 11:58 PM just as you go to submit your homework. Slip
days are to be used in exceptional circumstances, so you probably shouldn't get
close to using all four — if you feel that you will need that many, send me a message and we'll figure something out.</p>
<h4 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h4>
<p>You are highly encouraged to <em>think</em> about the homework problems together, but you must
turn in your own solutions written in your own words. We feel that discussing homework
problems is an excellent way to learn, but writing the solutions in your own words
promotes a deeper, more solid understanding than discussion alone.</p>
<p>We recommend the following way of working on the homeworks. First, meet with your
partner to discuss the solutions, but don't leave the meeting with anything written
down. Wait an hour or so, then write up the solutions in your own words working from
memory. In that hour, you inevitably forgot some of the details of the solution. If you
find that you have trouble filling them in, its a sign that you might not have
understood the solution as well as you first thought!</p>
<p>If you have any questions or worries about whether your collaboration constitutes
a violation of academic integrity, feel free to ask us on Campuswire.</p>
<h4 id="regrade-requests">Regrade Requests</h4>
<p>If you feel that the grader has made a mistake, you may submit a regrade request
via Gradescope within <strong>one week</strong> of the grades being released. Note that part
of your grade is clarity, so if your answer was mostly right but unclear you may
still not deserve full credit.</p>
<p><strong>Regrade</strong> requests are not the same thing as <strong>redemption</strong> requests (though both are
submitted on Gradescope in the same way.
<em>Any</em> problem, whether or not it is eligible for redemption, is eligible for a regrade
request if you feel that the grader has made a mistake.</p>
<h4 id="the-super-homework">The "Super Homework"</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, the registrar scheduled our final exam for the Saturday right after
classes end. This means that there isn't much time between our last few lectures and the
exam. Instead of putting material from these lectures into the exam, we have decided to
gather them into a "super homework" that covers topics from the last two weeks of the
quarter.</p>
<p>Because the super homework covers twice as much material as a usual homework, it will be
worth twice as much. Because this homework is the only assessment that covers this
material, it cannot be dropped. And because it comes so late in the quarter, we
unfortunately cannot offer redemption on the super homework. However, you may still
collaborate on the super homework as long as you write up solutions in your own words.</p>
<h2 id="exams">
<i class="em em-writing_hand" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i>
&nbsp;
Exams
</h2>

<h4 id="midterms">Midterms</h4>
<p>There will be two midterm exams:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Midterm 01</strong>: Thursday, February 04 (focuses on Lectures 01 &mdash; 08)</li>
<li><strong>Midterm 02</strong>: Thursday, March 04 (focuses on Lectures 09 &mdash; 15)</li>
</ul>
<p>The exams will not be at a specific time.
Instead, there will be a window of 24 hours during which you can start your exam, but once your
exam is started you will have 90 minutes to finish it.</p>
<h4 id="final-exam">Final Exam</h4>
<p>The final exam for DSC 40B is a "no fault" final split into two sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>An optional Midterm 01 "Redemption" section focusing on Lectures 01 &mdash; 08</li>
<li>An optional Midterm 02 "Redemption" section focusing on Lectures 09 &mdash; 15</li>
</ol>
<p>If your score on the midterm redemption section is higher than your score on the
original midterm, it will replace that grade. Getting a lower score on a
redemption section cannot hurt you (but it will make us sad). As a consequence,
the redemption sections are optional.</p>
<p>Under this policy, a bad performance on an earlier exam can be erased by good
performance on the same material in a later exam.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: You got an "F" on Midterm 1 and a "B" on Midterm 2. You decide to take only the
first redemption section on the final (though you could have taken both), and you
receive an "A". Your midterm scores are now "A" and "B".</p>
<p>The final exam will be held on Saturday, March 13 (as scheduled by the registrar). Like the midterms, you will be able to start the exam at any point in a 24 hour
period. Each section will be timed separately; you'll have 90 minutes for each.</p>
<p>Note that the topics from Lectures 16, 17, and 18 are not on any exam. These will
instead be tested in the <a href="#the-super-homework">Super Homework</a>.</p>
<h4 id="passing-threshold">Passing Threshold</h4>
<p>In order to pass the class, you must get at least 60% on <strong>both</strong> midterm exams (or the
equivalent redemption sections). That is, if you do not pass a midterm in either your
first attempt or in the redemption attempt,
you cannot pass the class.
Note that this is the case even if your other grades are good. For example, if you
receive an "A" on the first midterm, have a homework average of "A", but receive an "F"
on both the second midterm and its redemption section, you cannot pass the class.</p>
<p>The reason behind this policy is that receiving a non-passing grade on both the midterm and
its redemption section indicates a significant misunderstanding in a core aspect of the
course; since DSC 40B is a itself a core course in the data science major, passing with such a
gap in understanding will likely affect your ability to understand and succeed in future
courses.</p>
<h2 id="grading">
<i class="em em-100" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL"></i>
&nbsp;
Grading Scheme
</h2>

<p>We'll be using the following grading scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>40%:  Homeworks (lowest dropped)</li>
<li>10%: "Super Homework"</li>
<li>25%: Midterm 01 (or Redemption Midterm 01, whichever is larger)</li>
<li>25%: Midterm 02 (or Redemption Midterm 02, whichever is larger)</li>
</ul>
<p>You must score at least 60% on each of the midterms in order to pass the course (see
above).</p>
<p>In a typical quarter, the midterm redemption policy has the same effect as a traditional
"curve", therefore replacing the need for one.  The standard grading scale (where an A
is 93+, A- is 90+, B+ is 87+, etc.) will be used as a starting point, but once all
scores are in, we will run a clustering algorithm to automatically find the best cutoffs
for each letter grade. These cutoffs can only be lowered. For instance, the threshold
for an "A" will never be higher than 93%.</p>
<h2 id="illness">
<i class="em em-mask" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK"></i>
&nbsp;
Illnesses and Extenuating Circumstances
</h2>

<p>Because of the pandemic, we must prepare for the unfortunate possibility that
you will get sick and be unable to participate in this class for long periods of
time.  The university has a mechanism for helping in this situation: the
<strong>Incomplete</strong>. If you are unable to complete the course because of reasons
outside of your control, you may be given an Incomplete instead of a letter grade. This
simply means that you will complete the rest of the work at a later time. Once you have
done so, your overall grade is calculated and your Incomplete grade is replaced.</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger"> 
An Incomplete does not allow you to re-do work that has already been completed,
only to do work that hasn't been completed.
</div>

<p>Unfortunately, your personal health is not the only thing that might prevent
you from participating in this class. Some of us will get sick, others will have
family members fall ill, and others might lose their jobs. If you have
any doubt about your ability to perform satisfactorily in this course due to
something outside of your control, <strong>please contact us ASAP</strong> and we'll figure
something out.</p>

Frequently Asked Questions
</h2>

<h4 id="will-more-seats-be-added-what-are-my-chances-of-getting-off-of-the-wait-list">Will more seats be added / what are my chances of getting off of the wait list?</h4>
<p>It turns out that we instructors do not control the wait list, nor do we control the
number of seats in the class. From experience, the course is increased in size only
rarely, and typically not within a few weeks of the start date. We're also don't feel
comfortable guessing your chances of making it off of the waitlist.</p>
<p>We understand that remote instruction removes the constraint of physical classroom size.
The limiting factor therefore becomes the size of the course staff. Adding more people
to the class would require hiring more course staff, and this is typically not feasible
once the quarter is near.</p>
<h4 id="do-i-need-a-webcam-for-this-class">Do I need a webcam for this class?</h4>
<p>Nope! If you have one, you're welcome to use it; it can be especially useful to
share your work during office hours. But we won't require webcams. In
particular, we are <strong>not</strong> using proctoring services like examity.</p>
<h4 id="what-happens-if-the-professor-gets-sick-and-cant-run-the-course">What happens if the professor gets sick and can't run the course?</h4>
<p>We've prepared for this possibility in a couple of ways. Namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Backup" faculty have been selected who are ready to take over the course.</li>
<li>All grades will be stored in Canvas so that they are accessible to the
   university.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="is-this-class-curved">Is this class curved?</h4>
<p>In a typical quarter, the midterm redemption policy has the same effect as a traditional
"curve", therefore replacing the need for one.  The standard grading scale (where an A
is 93+, A- is 90+, B+ is 87+, etc.) will be used as a starting point, but once all
scores are in, we will run a clustering algorithm to automatically find the best cutoffs
for each letter grade. These cutoffs can only be lowered. For instance, the threshold
for an "A" will never be higher than 93%.</p>

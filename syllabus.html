    &nbsp;
    Getting Started
</h2>

<p>To get started in DSC 40B, you'll need to set up accounts on a couple of
websites.</p>
<h4 id="campuswire">Campuswire</h4>
<p>We'll be using <a href="https://campuswire.com/c/G01513287/feed">Campuswire</a>
as our course message board. Campuswire is like
Piazza, but unlike Piazza, Campuswire does not sell student data to third
parties. You should have received an invitation via email, but if not you should get in
touch with a course staff member as soon as possible, as I'll be making all
course announcements via Campuswire.</p>
<p>You can send me direct messages on Campuswire, but I may not be able to get back
to you immediately. Instead, in most cases it's recommended that you make a
<em>post</em> with your question. You can make your post anonymously, but other people
will be able to see and respond to your question.</p>
<h4 id="gradescope">Gradescope</h4>
<p>We'll be using 
<a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/194750">Gradescope</a> for
homework submission and grading. Most of the assignments will be a mixture of math and
coding, and the coding parts are usually autograded via Gradescope.,
You should have received an email invitation for Gradescope, but if not please
let us know as soon as possible (preferably via Campuswire).</p>
<h4 id="zoom">Zoom</h4>
<p>Some aspects of the course, like office hours and the remote discussion, will be held using
Zoom. You should already have an account through UCSD; see the <a href="https://edtech.ucsd.edu/education-continuity-tools-and-resources/zoom-guides.html">Zoom
guide</a>
for more help. Note that you will <strong>not</strong> be expected to have a webcam!</p>
<h4 id="canvas">Canvas</h4>
<p>We'll use <a href="canvas.ucsd.edu">Canvas</a> for the course gradebook and for the exams.</p>
<h2 id="materials">
<i class="em em-card_file_box" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i>
&nbsp;
Required Materials
</h2>

<p>No materials are required for this course; we'll use online video lectures as
the main resource, as well as our own course notes.
That said, here are some books that you might find useful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein, <em>Intruction to Algorithms</em></li>
<li>Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, Vazirani, <em>Algorithms</em></li>
</ul>
<p>You will <strong>not</strong> need a webcam, but you'll need a way to access the internet and
to upload pictures of your homework. If you foresee this being problematic
&mdash; or you find that you're unable to fully participate in the class for any
reason &mdash; send me a message on Campuswire and
we'll figure it out.</p>
<h2 id="lectures">
<i class="em em-male-teacher" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i>
&nbsp;
Lectures
</h2>

<p>DSC 40B is entirely online this quarter due to the <i class="em em-microbe"
aria-role="presentation" aria-label="MICROBE"></i>. As such, our lectures will
be <strong>video lectures</strong>.
There will be two video lectures per week. These lectures will be pre-recorded
and posted on the front page of this website. You will be able to watch them whenever is
most convenient for you.  I highly recommend that you watch each video, but doing so (or
not doing so) won't directly affect your grade.</p>
<p>Video lectures have a lot of benefits over "traditional" lectures — you can
pause them, rewind them, and speed them up, for instance. But there's no
equivalent of "raising your hand" and getting an immediate like there is in a
usual lecture. If you do have a question while watching a lecture, make a post
on Campuswire — we'll do our best to answer it ASAP.</p>
<h2 id="discussions">
<i class="em em-raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i>
&nbsp;
Discussions
</h2>

<p>We will have weekly, hour-long <strong>discussion</strong> sections focusing on solving problems.
Discussion will be held on Thursdays at 6:00 pm PST via Zoom.
The meeting link will be available on the front page of the course website, and
a discussion worksheet will be posted beforehand. During
discussion, you'll work together with classmates on solving these problems.</p>
<p>Virtual attendance in discussion section is recommended, but not required.
We'll record the discussion and post the link on the front page of the course
site.</p>
<h2 id="office-hours">
<i class="em em-hourglass_flowing_sand" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="HOURGLASS WITH FLOWING SAND"></i>
&nbsp;
Office Hours
</h2>

<p>Course staff, including tutors, TAs, and me (Justin), will hold office hours
regularly throughout the week. This quarter, all office hours will be via Zoom.
Please see the <a href="./office_hours.html">office hours</a> page for
the schedule and for instructions.</p>
<h2 id="homeworks">
<i class="em em-house_with_garden" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="HOUSE WITH GARDEN"></i>
&nbsp;
Homeworks
</h2>

<p>There will be eight homeworks assigned throughout the quarter.
Homeworks will be a mixture of written problems (which are manually graded by our tutor
staff) and coding problems (which are autograded).
Each homework will be due via
Gradescope at 11:59 PM on the Tuesday after it is assigned, and you'll have roughly a
week to complete each assignment from the time it is posted. The lowest homework will
be dropped.</p>
<h4 id="homework-redemption">Homework Redemption</h4>
<p>DSC 40B utilizes the concept of "redemption" on homework assignments. Under this policy,
you may regain full credit for a homework problem that was previously done incorrectly by
submitting an explanation of your mistake along with a correction.
This policy encourages you to revisit homework mistakes in order to correct your
understanding, and allows us to give quick, targeted feedback through grading.</p>
<p>Not all homework problems are eligible for redemption, unfortunately, as we do not have
the resources to regrade longer, more involved problems. Those problems that <em>are</em>
eligible for redemption will be marked as such. The policy of dropping the lowest
homework serves to offer some relief in the case that you perform poorly on problems
that are not eligible for redemption.</p>
<p>Problems that are eligible for redemption are graded as either right or wrong with
no partial credit according to the following scale:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="text-success font-weight-bold">Green</span>: You had the right idea,
        and you get full credit for the problem.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="text-warning font-weight-bold">Yellow</span>: Your approach
        showed effort, but wasn't right. For now it will receive zero credit, but you
        can receive full credit by submitting a proper "redemption request" (see below).
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="text-danger font-weight-bold">Red</span>: You didn't answer
        the problem, or showed no work. No credit is awarded and you are not permitted
        to submit a redemption request.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If you got the problem correct, you'll receive the total number of points for it. If you
didn't get the problem correct, even due to a relatively small mistake, you'll receive no
credit <em>until</em> you submit a redemption request. In this way, everyone will eventually
receive full credit on every problem that is eligible for redemption, <em>provided</em> that
they submit redemption requests.</p>
<h4 id="redemption-requests">Redemption Requests</h4>
<p>To submit a redemption request for a 
<span class="text-warning font-weight-bold">Yellow</span> solution:</p>
<ol>
<li>Review your answer to find your mistake, comparing it to the solutions posted
   on the course webpage.</li>
<li>Submit a <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/help#help-center-item-student-regrades">regrade
   request</a>
   for the problem on Gradescope, or by attending a tutor's office hours. In your
   regrade request, identify your mistake and what you would need to do to correct it.
   The amount of detail needed in your request depends on how complex your mistake was;
   if it was a simple one, only one or two sentences may be necessary.</li>
<li>A grader will review your request shortly (as long as you submit it
   within a week of the homework scores being posted, your regrade request will
   be reviewed). If you aren't able to identify what you did incorrectly, you'll
   be asked to attend a grader's office hours in order to discuss the problem in
   more detail.</li>
</ol>
<div class="alert alert-danger"> 
Warning! We will not be able to handle redemption requests which are submitted more than
a week after you have received your grade.
</div>

<h4 id="slip-days">Slip Days</h4>
<p>You have four "slip days" to use throughout the quarter. A slip day extends the
deadline of any one homework by 24 hours. Slip days can't be "stacked" &mdash;
the latest any one homework can be submitted is 24 hours after the deadline.
Slip days are applied automatically at the end of the quarter, but it's your
responsibility to keep track of how many you have left.</p>
<p>Slip days are designed to be a transparent and predictable source of leniency in
deadlines. You can use a slip day if you are too busy to complete an assignment on its
original due date (or if you forgot about it). But slips days are also meant for things
like the internet going down at 11:58 PM just as you go to submit your homework. Slip
days are to be used in exceptional circumstances, so you probably shouldn't get
close to using all four — if you feel that you will need that many due to a reason like
illness or depression, send me a message and we'll figure something out.</p>
<h4 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h4>
<p>Starting with Homework 03, you may work on homeworks in <em>pairs</em> and submit one
assignment for the both of you. Note that you should both work on each problem together;
you <em>shouldn't</em> divvy up the problems, so that one of you solves problems 1-3 and the
other solves 4-6. Of course, we have no idea of knowing how you worked on the homeworks,
so a word of warning: the homeworks are meant to be preparation for the exams, so if you
only understand half of the homework problems, you should expect a score ~50% on the
exams.</p>
<p>Here's the recommended way for working on the assignments as a pair. You should each
take a look at the homework problems separately and attempt your own solution. Then you
can meet over Zoom to discuss each problem and write up your solution document together.</p>
<p>Working in a pair is optional. If you'd like to find someone to work with, we'll be
making a Campuswire post where you can request a partner.</p>
<h4 id="regrade-requests">Regrade Requests</h4>
<p>If you feel that the grader has made a mistake, you may submit a regrade request
via Gradescope within <strong>one week</strong> of the grades being released. Note that part
of your grade is clarity, so if your answer was mostly right but unclear you may
still not deserve full credit.</p>
<p>Any problem, whether or not it is eligible for redemption, is eligible for a regrade
request if you feel that the grader has made a mistake.</p>
<h2 id="exams">
<i class="em em-writing_hand" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i>
&nbsp;
Exams
</h2>

<p>There will be two midterms and one final exam, held on the following dates:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Midterm 01</strong>: Tuesday, November 10 (covers Lectures 1 &mdash; 7)</li>
<li><strong>Midterm 02</strong>: Thursday, December 03 (covers Lectures 8 &mdash; 15)</li>
<li><strong>Final Exam</strong>: Wednesday, December 16 </li>
</ul>
<p>The exams will not be at a specific time.
Instead, there will be a window of 24 hours during which you can start your exam, but once your
exam is started you will have a limited amount of time to finish it: 1.5 hours for the
midterm and 3 hours for the final exam.</p>
<h4 id="exam-redemption">Exam Redemption</h4>
<p>DSC 40B utilizes the concept of exam "redemption". Under this policy, a bad performance
on an earlier exam can be erased by good performance on the same material in a later
exam.</p>
<p>Redemption is implemented as follows. The final exam will be split into three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>The mandatory final exam section, covering Lectures 16 &mdash; 18</li>
<li>An optional Midterm 01 "Redemption" section covering Lectures 01 &mdash; 07</li>
<li>An optional Midterm 02 "Redemption" section covering Lectures 08 &mdash; 15</li>
</ol>
<p>If your score on the midterm redemption section is higher than your score on the
original midterm, it will replace that grade. Getting a lower score on a
redemption section cannot hurt you (but it will make me sad). As a consequence,
the redemption sections are optional.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: You got an "F" on Midterm 1 and a "B" on Midterm 2. You decide to take only the
first redemption section on the final (though you could have taken both), and you
receive an "A". Your midterm scores are now "A" and "B".</p>
<h4 id="passing-threshold">Passing Threshold</h4>
<p>In order to pass the class, you must get at least 60% on <strong>both</strong> midterm exams (or the
equivalent redemption sections). That is, if you do not pass a midterm in either your
first attempt or in the redemption attempt,
you cannot pass the class.
Note that this is the case even if your other grades are good. For example, if you
receive an "A" on the first midterm, have a homework average of "A", but receive an "F"
on both the second midterm and its redemption section, you cannot pass the class.</p>
<p>The reason behind this policy is that receiving a non-passing grade on both the midterm and
its redemption section indicates a significant misunderstanding in a core aspect of the
course; since DSC 40B is a core course in the data science major, passing with such a
gap in understanding will likely affect your ability to understand and succeed in future
courses.</p>
<h2 id="grading">
<i class="em em-100" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL"></i>
&nbsp;
Grading Scheme
</h2>

<p>We'll be using the following grading scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>35%:  Homework Assignments (lowest dropped)</li>
<li>25%: Midterm 01 (or Redemption Midterm 01, whichever is larger)</li>
<li>25%: Midterm 02 (or Redemption Midterm 02, whichever is larger)</li>
<li>15%: Final Exam Mandatory Section</li>
</ul>
<p>The final exam mandatory section is worth a relatively small percentage of your
grade because it covers only 4 lectures.</p>
<p>You must score at least 60% on each of the midterms in order to pass the course (see
above).</p>
<p>In a typical quarter, the midterm redemption policy has the same effect as a traditional
"curve", therefore replacing the need for one.
Once all scores are in, I will run a clustering algorithm to automatically find the best
cutoffs for each letter grade, but these cutoffs can only be lowered. For instance, the
threshold for an "A" will never be higher than 93%.</p>
<h2 id="illness">
<i class="em em-mask" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="FACE WITH MEDICAL MASK"></i>
&nbsp;
Illnesses and Extenuating Circumstances
</h2>

<p>Because of the pandemic, we must prepare for the unfortunate possibility that
you will get sick and be unable to participate in this class for long periods of
time.  The university has a mechanism for helping in this situation: the
<strong>Incomplete</strong>. If you are unable to complete the course because of reasons
outside of your control, you may be given an Incomplete instead of a letter grade. This
simply means that you will complete the rest of the work at a later time. Once you have
done so, your overall grade is calculated and your Incomplete grade is replaced.</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger"> 
An Incomplete does not allow you to re-do work that has already been completed,
only to do work that hasn't been completed.
</div>

<p>Unfortunately, your personal health is not the only thing that might prevent
you from participating in this class. Some of us will get sick, others will have
family members fall ill, and others might lose their jobs. If you have
any doubt about your ability to perform satisfactorily in this course due to
something outside of your control, <strong>please contact me ASAP</strong> and we'll figure
something out.</p>

Frequently Asked Questions
</h2>

<h4 id="do-i-need-a-webcam-for-this-class">Do I need a webcam for this class?</h4>
<p>Nope! If you have one, you're welcome to use it; it can be especially useful to
share your work during office hours. But we won't require webcams. In
particular, we are <strong>not</strong> using proctoring services like examity.</p>
<h4 id="what-happens-if-the-professor-gets-sick-and-cant-run-the-course">What happens if the professor gets sick and can't run the course?</h4>
<p>We've prepared for this possibility in a couple of ways. Namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Backup" faculty have been selected who are ready to take over the course.</li>
<li>All grades will be stored in Canvas so that they are accessible to the
   university.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="is-this-class-curved">Is this class curved?</h4>
<p>In a typical quarter, the midterm redemption policy has the same effect as a traditional
"curve", therefore replacing the need for one.
Once all scores are in, I will run a clustering algorithm to automatically find the best
cutoffs for each letter grade, but these cutoffs can only be lowered. For instance, the
threshold for an "A" <em>might</em> be lowered to a 92.5%, but it will never be raised above
93%.</p>
